# Codesmith Colorscheme for Vim

This colorscheme was originally forked from the "Darcula" colorscheme 
(alem0lars/vim-colorscheme-darcula)[http://github.com/alem0lars/vim-colorscheme-darcula].

The colors were not quite right in 256-color terminals, so I tweaked them to my
liking.

## Install with Vundle

Add this Plugin line to `.vimrc`:

    call vundle#begin()
    ...
    Plugin 'thecodesmith/vim-colorscheme-codesmith'
    ...
    call vundle#end()
